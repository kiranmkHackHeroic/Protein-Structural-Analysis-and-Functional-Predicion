# Protein-Structural-Analysis-and-Functional-Predicion

This project focuses on understanding the three-dimensional structure of a protein and predicting its biological function using computational bioinformatics tools. Since the structure of a protein directly determines its role in the cell, analyzing both aspects helps in understanding molecular mechanisms, disease associations, and potential therapeutic applications.

The project begins by selecting a protein of interest and retrieving its amino acid sequence from biological databases such as UniProt. Using this sequence, various computational approaches are applied to model its structure, analyze structural features, and predict its function.

The structural analysis includes identifying the protein’s primary, secondary, and tertiary structural elements, evaluating domain organization, and validating the predicted 3D model using standard assessment tools. Functional prediction is performed by comparing the protein with known homologs, identifying conserved motifs and domains, predicting active or ligand-binding sites, and assessing possible molecular interactions.

Modern AI-based tools such as AlphaFold, along with classical modeling platforms like SWISS-MODEL, are used to generate accurate structure predictions. Tools such as Pfam, InterPro, PROSITE, and CASTp support domain and active site identification, while molecular docking software helps infer potential ligand interactions.

Overall, this project demonstrates how computational biology techniques can be used to determine the structural and functional characteristics of proteins. These insights are valuable for applications in drug discovery, disease mutation analysis, and protein engineering. The project highlights the importance of bioinformatics in understanding biomolecules without the need for labor-intensive laboratory experiments.
