## 💡 Key Talking Points

### **Opening**
> "Bioinformatics research requires jumping between 10+ databases. This app integrates everything in one interface."

### **The Power of Structure**
> "One single mutation in hemoglobin—from Glutamic acid to Valine—causes the entire protein to polymerize, distorting red blood cells into sickles. This affects 100 million people globally."

### **From Computation to Clinic**
> "Voxelotor was designed specifically to increase hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, preventing polymerization. FDA approved it in 2019. This is computational biology saving real lives."

### **Why It Matters**
> "Modern bioinformatics isn't just about analyzing data—it's about solving real problems and developing treatments that save lives."

## 🎯 If Something Goes Wrong...

### **No Internet?**
- Have screenshots ready
- Show the code (HTML source in browser)
- Explain the algorithm in detail

### **API Slow?**
- Pre-load P69905, P04637, P01308 before presenting
- Or demonstrate with the static demo videos/GIFs

### **3D Viewer Not Loading?**
- Show the PDB file directly (1A3N.pdb in /data folder)
- Explain what 3Dmol.js does

### **Professor Asks Complex Question?**
- "Great question - that's exactly what Phase 2 will address"
- Fall back to: algorithm details, code walkthrough, or technical stack
