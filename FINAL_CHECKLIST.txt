QUICK-LOAD BUTTON LOCATIONS
========================================

On the website you'll see:

📌 QUICK EXAMPLES (Always Visible):
   🔴 Hemoglobin    💉 Insulin    ⚠️ p53    🎀 HER2    🧬 BRCA1

🔬 MORE PROTEINS (Click to Expand):
   🔴 Cancer-Related:    Src Kinase, TNF-α, p73
   🧬 Metabolic:         ApoB-100, PPARγ
   ⚡ Antioxidant:       SOD2
   🔗 Signaling & DNA:   Delta-1, RelA/p65, Ubiquitin

HOW TO USE:
1. Click any button
2. It auto-loads the protein
3. Analysis starts automatically
4. No need to type or click "Analyze"

========================================
DEMO DAY FLOW
========================================

BEFORE DEMO:
☐ Test internet connection
☐ Open http://localhost:8080/protein_analyzer.html
